# RoRRRandomizer
* Adds a survivor, skill, and artifact randomizer when you start a game.
* You can set the mod options via ImGui ("INSERT" key) or by editing the it manually (found at ReturnOfModding/config/RoRRRandomizer/cfg.toml).
* 
* As of v1.0.3 you can now enable/disable skills in the ImGui settings. 
* You can make a custom build by enabling only 4 skills

## Disclaimer
* This mod doesn't choose the random skills intelligently, using some skills can do nothing or lead to crashes.
* You can help with testing this by noting down and notifying me of broken skills (the skill id should appear in the console).
* Runs played with this mod are saved under the character that was selected in the lobby, not the random one set by the randomizer.
* This mod hasn't been tested in multiplayer, but it should probably work for the Host and randomize all players.
