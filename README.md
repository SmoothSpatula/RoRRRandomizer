Adds a survivor, skill, and artifact randomizer when you start a game.
You can set the mod options via ImGui ("INSERT" key) or by editing the it manually (found at ReturnOfModding/config/RoRRRandomizer/cfg.toml).

---

## Disclaimer
* This mod doesn't choose the random skills intelligently, using some skills can do nothing or lead to crashes.
* Runs played with this mod are saved under the character that was selected in the lobby, not the random one set by the randomizer.
* This mod hasn't been tested in multiplayer, but it should probably work as the Host.

## Installation Instructions

* If you are not using the mod manager, you will need manually create a "ReturnOfModding/config/RoRRRandomizer" folder for the config.

* This mod depends on the [Return Of Modding](https://github.com/return-of-modding/ReturnOfModding) loader:

2. Download this mod and extract it into the `ReturnOfModding/plugins` folder.
